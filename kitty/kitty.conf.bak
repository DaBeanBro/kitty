Fonts {{{

#: kitty has very powerful font management. You can configure
#: individual font faces and even specify special fonts for particular
#: characters.

font_family      Jetbrains Mono
bold_font        auto
italic_font      auto
bold_italic_font auto

font_size 13.0

# force_ltr no

disable_ligatures never

}}}

Performance tuning {{{

repaint_delay 1

#: Delay between screen updates (in milliseconds). Decreasing it,
#: increases frames-per-second (FPS) at the cost of more CPU usage.
#: The default value yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for
#: most uses. Note that to actually achieve 100 FPS, you have to
#: either set sync_to_monitor to no or use a monitor with a high
#: refresh rate. Also, to minimize latency when there is pending input
#: to be processed, this option is ignored.

# input_delay 1

#: Delay before input from the program running in the terminal is
#: processed (in milliseconds). Note that decreasing it will increase
#: responsiveness, but also increase CPU usage and might cause flicker
#: in full screen programs that redraw the entire screen on each loop,
#: because kitty is so fast that partial screen updates will be drawn.

# sync_to_monitor yes

#: Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This
#: prevents screen tearing
#: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing> when scrolling.
#: However, it limits the rendering speed to the refresh rate of your
#: monitor. With a very high speed mouse/high keyboard repeat rate,
#: you may notice some slight input latency. If so, set this to no.
}}}

Window layout {{{

remember_window_size  yes
initial_window_width  1000
initial_window_height 1000

#: The width of window borders. Can be either in pixels (px) or pts
#: (pt). Values in pts will be rounded to the nearest number of pixels
#: based on screen resolution. If not specified, the unit is assumed
#: to be pts. Note that borders are displayed only when more than one
#: window is visible. They are meant to separate multiple windows.

draw_minimal_borders yes

#: Draw only the minimum borders needed. This means that only the
#: borders that separate the window from a neighbor are drawn. Note
#: that setting a non-zero window_margin_width overrides this and
#: causes all borders to be drawn.

window_margin_width 24

#: The window margin (in pts) (blank area outside the border). A
#: single value sets all four sides. Two values set the vertical and
#: horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal and bottom. Four
#: values set top, right, bottom and left.

# single_window_margin_width -1

#: The window margin to use when only a single window is visible (in
#: pts). Negative values will cause the value of window_margin_width
#: to be used instead. A single value sets all four sides. Two values
#: set the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top,
#: horizontal and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.

window_padding_width 4

#: The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the
#: window border). A single value sets all four sides. Two values set
#: the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal
#: and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.

active_border_color #ffff00

#: The color for the border of the active window. Set this to none to
#: not draw borders around the active window.

inactive_border_color #cccccc

#: The color for the border of inactive windows.

# bell_border_color #ff5a00

#: The color for the border of inactive windows in which a bell has
#: occurred.

inactive_text_alpha 0.5

#: Fade the text in inactive windows by the specified amount (a number
#: between zero and one, with zero being fully faded).

hide_window_decorations yes

#: Hide the window decorations (title-bar and window borders) with
#: yes. On macOS, titlebar-only and titlebar-and-corners can be used
#: to only hide the titlebar and the rounded corners. Whether this
#: works and exactly what effect it has depends on the window
#: manager/operating system. Note that the effects of changing this
#: option when reloading config are undefined. When using titlebar-
#: only, it is useful to also set window_margin_width and
#: placement_strategy to prevent the rounded corners from clipping
#: text. Or use titlebar-and-corners.

}}}

Color scheme {{{
# foreground #dddddd
# background #000000

#: The foreground and background colors.

background_opacity 0.88

#: The opacity of the background. A number between zero and one, where
#: one is opaque and zero is fully transparent. This will only work if
#: supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
#: X11). Note that it only sets the background color's opacity in
#: cells that have the same background color as the default terminal
#: background, so that things like the status bar in vim, powerline
#: prompts, etc. still look good. But it means that if you use a color
#: theme with a background color in your editor, it will not be
#: rendered as transparent. Instead you should change the default
#: background color in your kitty config and not use a background
#: color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape codes to set
#: the terminals default colors in a shell script to launch your
#: editor. Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a (possibly
#: significant) performance hit. When using a low value for this
#: setting, it is desirable that you set the background color to a
#: color the matches the general color of the desktop background, for
#: best text rendering.  If you want to dynamically change
#: transparency of windows, set dynamic_background_opacity to yes
#: (this is off by default as it has a performance cost). Changing
#: this option when reloading the config will only work if
#: dynamic_background_opacity was enabled in the original config.

background_blur 48

#: Set to a positive value to enable background blur (blurring of the
#: visuals behind a transparent window) on platforms that support it.
#: Only takes effect when background_opacity is less than one. On
#: macOS, this will also control the blur radius (amount of blurring).
#: Setting it to too high a value will cause severe performance issues
#: and/or rendering artifacts. Usually, values up to 64 work well.
#: Note that this might cause performance issues, depending on how the
#: platform implements it, so use with care. Currently supported on
#: macOS and KDE under X11.

# background_image none

#: Path to a background image. Must be in PNG format.

# background_image_layout tiled

#: Whether to tile, scale or clamp the background image. The value can
#: be one of tiled, mirror-tiled, scaled, clamped, centered or
#: cscaled. The scaled and cscaled values scale the image to the
#: window size, with cscaled preserving the image aspect ratio.

# background_image_linear no

#: When background image is scaled, whether linear interpolation
#: should be used.

dynamic_background_opacity yes

#: Allow changing of the background_opacity dynamically, using either
#: keyboard shortcuts (increase_background_opacity and
#: decrease_background_opacity) or the remote control facility.
#: Changing this option by reloading the config is not supported.

Advanced {{{

shell .

#: The shell program to execute. The default value of . means to use
#: whatever shell is set as the default shell for the current user.
#: Note that on macOS if you change this, you might need to add
#: --login and --interactive to ensure that the shell starts in
#: interactive mode and reads its startup rc files. Environment
#: variables are expanded in this setting.

editor nvim

#: The terminal based text editor (such as vim or nano) to use when
#: editing the kitty config file or similar tasks.

#: The default value of . means to use the environment variables
#: VISUAL and EDITOR in that order. If these variables aren't set,
#: kitty will run your shell ($SHELL -l -i -c env) to see if your
#: shell startup rc files set VISUAL or EDITOR. If that doesn't work,
#: kitty will cycle through various known editors (vim, emacs, etc.)
#: and take the first one that exists on your system.

}}}

Keyboard shortcuts {{{

#: Keys are identified simply by their lowercase Unicode characters.
#: For example: a for the A key, [ for the left square bracket key,
#: etc. For functional keys, such as Enter or Escape, the names are
#: present at Functional key definitions
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/#functional>.
#: For modifier keys, the names are ctrl (control, ⌃), shift (⇧), alt
#: (opt, option, ⌥), super (cmd, command, ⌘). See also: GLFW mods
#: <https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__mods.html>

#: On Linux you can also use XKB key names to bind keys that are not
#: supported by GLFW. See XKB keys
#: <https://github.com/xkbcommon/libxkbcommon/blob/master/include/xkbcommon/xkbcommon-
#: keysyms.h> for a list of key names. The name to use is the part
#: after the XKB_KEY_ prefix. Note that you can only use an XKB key
#: name for keys that are not known as GLFW keys.

#: Finally, you can use raw system key codes to map keys, again only
#: for keys that are not known as GLFW keys. To see the system key
#: code for a key, start kitty with the kitty --debug-input option,
#: kitty will output some debug text for every key event. In that text
#: look for native_code, the value of that becomes the key name in the
#: shortcut. For example:

#: .. code-block:: none

#:     on_key_input: glfw key: 0x61 native_code: 0x61 action: PRESS mods: none text: 'a'

#: Here, the key name for the A key is 0x61 and you can use it with::

#:     map ctrl+0x61 something

#: to map Ctrl+A to something.

#: You can use the special action no_op to unmap a keyboard shortcut
#: that is assigned in the default configuration::

#:     map kitty_mod+space no_op

#: If you would like kitty to completely ignore a key event, not even
#: sending it to the program running in the terminal, map it to
#: discard_event::

#:     map kitty_mod+f1 discard_event

#: You can combine multiple actions to be triggered by a single
#: shortcut with combine action, using the syntax below::

#:     map key combine <separator> action1 <separator> action2 <separator> action3 ...

#: For example::

#:     map kitty_mod+e combine : new_window : next_layout

#: This will create a new window and switch to the next available
#: layout.

#: You can use multi-key shortcuts with the syntax shown below::

#:     map key1>key2>key3 action

#: For example::

#:     map ctrl+f>2 set_font_size 20

#: The full list of actions that can be mapped to key presses is
#: available here <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/actions/>.

kitty_mod cmd+shift

#: Special modifier key alias for default shortcuts. You can change
#: the value of this option to alter all default shortcuts that use
#: kitty_mod.

# clear_all_shortcuts no

#: Remove all shortcut definitions up to this point. Useful, for
#: instance, to remove the default shortcuts.

# action_alias

#: E.g. action_alias launch_tab launch --type=tab --cwd=current

#: Define action aliases to avoid repeating the same options in
#: multiple mappings. Aliases can be defined for any action and will
#: be expanded recursively. For example, the above alias allows you to
#: create mappings to launch a new tab in the current working
#: directory without duplication::

#:     map f1 launch_tab vim
#:     map f2 launch_tab emacs

#: Similarly, to alias kitten invocation::

#:     action_alias hints kitten hints --hints-offset=0

# kitten_alias

#: E.g. kitten_alias hints hints --hints-offset=0

#: Like action_alias above, but specifically for kittens. Generally,
#: prefer to use action_alias. This option is a legacy version,
#: present for backwards compatibility. It causes all invocations of
#: the aliased kitten to be substituted. So the example above will
#: cause all invocations of the hints kitten to have the --hints-
#: offset=0 option applied.

Clipboard {{{

#: Copy to clipboard

map kitty_mod+c copy_to_clipboard
map cmd+c       copy_to_clipboard

#::  There is also a copy_or_interrupt action that can be optionally
#::  mapped to Ctrl+C. It will copy only if there is a selection and
#::  send an interrupt otherwise. Similarly,
#::  copy_and_clear_or_interrupt will copy and clear the selection or
#::  send an interrupt if there is no selection.

#: Paste from clipboard

map kitty_mod+v paste_from_clipboard
map cmd+v       paste_from_clipboard

#: Paste from selection

map kitty_mod+s  paste_from_selection
map shift+insert paste_from_selection

#: Pass selection to program

# map kitty_mod+o pass_selection_to_program

#::  You can also pass the contents of the current selection to any
#::  program with pass_selection_to_program. By default, the system's
#::  open program is used, but you can specify your own, the selection
#::  will be passed as a command line argument to the program. For
#::  example::

#::      map kitty_mod+o pass_selection_to_program firefox

#::  You can pass the current selection to a terminal program running
#::  in a new kitty window, by using the @selection placeholder::

#::      map kitty_mod+y new_window less @selection

}}}

Font sizes {{{

#: You can change the font size for all top-level kitty OS windows at
#: a time or only the current one.

#: Increase font size

map kitty_mod+equal  change_font_size all +1.0
map kitty_mod+plus   change_font_size all +1.0
map kitty_mod+kp_add change_font_size all +1.0
map cmd+plus         change_font_size all +1.0
map cmd+equal        change_font_size all +1.0
map shift+cmd+equal  change_font_size all +1.0

#: Decrease font size

map kitty_mod+minus       change_font_size all -1.0
map kitty_mod+kp_subtract change_font_size all -1.0
map cmd+minus             change_font_size all -1.0
map shift+cmd+minus       change_font_size all -1.0

#: Reset font size

map kitty_mod+backspace change_font_size all 0
